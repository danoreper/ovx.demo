##Global props
##the root directory of all output
output: ../output

##the root directory of (almost) all data, with the exception of things that are too big to hold on
##local machines and in dropbox, such as rnaseq data
data: ../data

##The root directory of all temp files that are generated. 
tmpdir: ../output/tmp

##whether we are running on the lsf cluster or on local machine
onCluster: no

##OVX specific properties
ovx:

  ##the column in input data describing the ID associated with each
  idcol: ANIMAL.ID

  ##The jags model used for estimating strain by treatment effects
  modelname: ./ovx/model.delta.bug

  ##The number of sampling iteration for Jags
  iter: 10000

  ##Thin constant for Jags
  thin: 10

  ##Fraction of discarded burn in samples for Jags. Min 0, max 1.
  burninfrac: 0.2

  ##Number of randomly matched imputations generated in the course of permutation testing and estimation of strain by treatment effects
  numImp: 3

  ##If discretization is needed, the buckets over which to discretize p-values
  discreteBuckets:
  - 0.0
  - 0.05
  - 1.0e-01
  - 1.0

  ## the number of cores to use to run model fitting in parallel across imputations.
  ##if Distributing jobs accross the cluster, set this to 1.
  mc.cores: 1

  ## The amount of memory requested per job, in GB, when running on the cluster
  clusterMemLim: 6

  clusterQueue: hour

  ## IF imputations are failing, and we want to ensure a certain number of imputations succeed,
  ##do extra.imp.multuple * numImp worth of imputations
  extra.imp.multiple: 1

  ## for the main scripts, there is a slow step of actually fitting the models, and a fast step
  ## of plotting the data, writing tables, etc. If we want to just do the fast steps, and load results from file, set rebuildData to no
  rebuildData: yes
